Creating a movie app

This app is created with the help of the tutorial video which can be accessed through the link: https://youtu.be/b9eMGE7QtTk?si=ato445K0DT6FcetC . This tutorial helped me focus on the React part of the website, all the CSS being imported from there.

This React website contains a search input, in which we can type in any movie name and with the help of public APIs , we get all the movie cards which have that movie name. The movie cards are created by a separate component and every movie card contains the name of the movie and the corresponding year, which are displayed if the user hovers over the movie card.
If no movie is found with the inputed name or if the website is firstly loaded or reloaded by refreshing, under the serach button a warning message is displayed, saying that there are no movies found.

To run the server and view the website, install the React working environment ( instructions provided in the following video, 5:06 - 9:15): https://youtu.be/SqcY0GlETPk?si=4pgRQw2NKLe2CeIe
Then, replace the src folder with the one attached in this repository.

Alternatively, you can download the archived file attached.
