Creating a movie app

This app is created with the help of the tutorial video which can be accessed through the link: https://youtu.be/b9eMGE7QtTk?si=ato445K0DT6FcetC . This tutorial helped me focus on the React part of the website, all the CSS being imported from there.



To run the server and view the website, install the React working environment ( instructions provided in the following video, 5:06 - 9:15): https://youtu.be/SqcY0GlETPk?si=4pgRQw2NKLe2CeIe
Then, replace the src folder with the one attached in this repository.

Alternatively, you can download the archived file attached.
